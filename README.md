# Music-and-Mental-Health-DA
Music and Mental Health Data Analysis Project

I am currently a data science fellow studying with the NYC Data Science Academy.

This project focuses on using Python packages and libraries to effectively analyze data and visualize insights and findings, specifically pandas, Matpplotlib and Seaborn.

In this project, I conducted exploratory data analysis to investigate whether favorite music genre could be linked to mental health patterns. I specifically focused on anxiety and depression scores. In addition to genre analysis, I engineered new features such as age group, and explored how listening to music while working related to mental health outcomes. Through data visualization, including distribution plots, bar charts, and cross‑tab comparisons, I examined relationships between demographic factors, listening habits, and mental health indicators. This allowed me to uncover nuanced patterns in how lifestyle behaviors and music preferences intersect with wellbeing in a structured, data‑driven way.
